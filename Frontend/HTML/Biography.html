               Kyriq Cole is the owner of Kyriq Cafe and has run the resturaunt for over 30 years.
                <br> Over the years the resturaunt has become famous for its shrimp dishes and Kyriq is committed to
                serving all his customers.
                <br> Kyriq started his career in cuisine at a Texas Roadhouse when he was only 16 working his way up from bus boy to owner.
                <br> He trained and mastered his cooking techniques until he was well versed enough to open a second resturaunt.
                <br> In 2016 he sold all his resturaunts for $100 million. He now spends his time giving back to students at the campus.
                <br> In his free time Kyriq loves to grill steak and shrimp. 
                In 2020 Kyriq had a 1 versus 1 with Gordon Ramsay and lost 45-0.
